start by parsing each to make a 2d array
first find all intersections, where there is a 1 on both arrays, search
for each note the cords in an array of structs
Manhattan distance to sort array and choose lowest



latter reparse the original strings keeping track of the the cords along the way
    have struct that stores the cords of each intersection and the index of when the cross happens
        inital value for indexes will be 0
        every 20 cycles, check if there is a cord where the added steps is < cycles * 2, exclude 0 steps
    Remove all cords where there is a 0 in the steps
    Sort by added steps, return the min
